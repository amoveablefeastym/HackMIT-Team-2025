        **Telehealth Appointment Transcript**

**Platform:** HealthConnect Secure Video
**Date:** September 14, 2025
**Time:** 10:30 AM - 11:00 AM EDT
**Participants:**
* Dr. Anya Sharma, MD (Internal Medicine)
* Mr. David Chen (Patient)

**(The video call connects. Dr. Sharma is in her home office, with a bookshelf behind her. Mr. Chen is sitting at his kitchen table.)**

**[00:00:00] Dr. Anya Sharma:** Good morning, David. Can you hear and see me okay?

**[00:00:05] Mr. David Chen:** Hi, Dr. Sharma. Yes, loud and clear. How about me? The connection seems a bit fuzzy on my end.

**[00:00:12] Dr. Anya Sharma:** You&#x27;re coming through perfectly. The video is sharp and the audio is clear. As long as you can hear me, we should be fine. Before we begin, can you please confirm your full name and date of birth for me?

**[00:00:25] Mr. David Chen:** Sure. It&#x27;s David Wei Chen, date of birth is May 12, 1973.

**[00:00:34] Dr. Anya Sharma:** Excellent, thank you, David. So, the record shows this is a scheduled follow-up. We were planning to check in on your blood pressure and review your lab work from a few months ago. What would you like to discuss today?

**[00:00:51] Mr. David Chen:** Yeah, that&#x27;s right. The blood pressure is the main thing. But actually, the reason I didn&#x27;t just want to do a simple refill request is that I&#x27;ve been dealing with <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">this really annoying cough</span> for the past, oh, I don&#x27;t know, two or three weeks. It just won&#x27;t go away. And I&#x27;ve been <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">feeling incredibly run down</span>.

**[00:01:15] Dr. Anya Sharma:** I see. I&#x27;m sorry to hear that. Let&#x27;s definitely focus on that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">cough</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">fatigue</span> first, and then we&#x27;ll circle back to your ongoing management for the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">hypertension</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">cholesterol</span>. Tell me more about this <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">cough</span>. When exactly did it start?

**[00:01:32] Mr. David Chen:** Let&#x27;s see... my daughter had a cold she brought home from school about a month ago. I think I started feeling <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">a little scratch in my throat</span> maybe three weeks ago, and it&#x27;s just kind of settled in my chest since then. It’s not an all-day-long <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">cough</span>, but I have these fits, especially in the morning when I wake up and then again at night when I lie down.

**[00:01:58] Dr. Anya Sharma:** Okay. And when you cough, would you describe it as a dry cough, or are you bringing anything up?

**[00:02:06] Mr. David Chen:** It was <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">dry at first, really tickly and irritating</span>. For the last week or so, there’s been a bit of... uh... <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">stuff coming up. Phlegm</span>, I guess. It&#x27;s mostly clear or whitish. Nothing green or yellow, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re asking.

**[00:02:25] Dr. Anya Sharma:** That&#x27;s a very helpful detail, thank you. Have you had any other symptoms along with this <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">cough</span></span>? For example, any <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">fever</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">chills</span>, or <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">body aches</span>?

**[00:02:37] Mr. David Chen:** When it first started, I felt generally crummy. I had a bit of a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">headache behind my eyes</span> and some <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">mild body aches</span>, but I checked my temperature a few times and it never went above 99.5 Fahrenheit. No real fever to speak of. The main thing besides the cough is just this <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">bone-deep tiredness</span>. I feel like I&#x27;m walking through molasses.

**[00:03:05] Dr. Anya Sharma:** I understand. And what about <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">shortness of breath</span>? Do you feel winded when you&#x27;re walking around the house, going up stairs, or when you&#x27;re having one of those coughing fits?

**[00:03:18] Mr. David Chen:** Not really short of breath like I can&#x27;t breathe. But sometimes, after a long coughing spell, I feel a bit of a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">tightness in my chest</span> and I have to sit down for a minute to catch my breath. It&#x27;s not painful, just... tight.

**[00:03:36] Dr. Anya Sharma:** Okay. Any <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">sore throat</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">sinus pressure</span>, or <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">runny nose</span>?

**[00:03:42] Mr. David Chen:** The <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">sore throat</span> was there for the first few days, but that&#x27;s gone now. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">My nose has been a little stuffy</span>, especially at night. I wake up and can only breathe through my mouth.

**[00:03:55] Dr. Anya Sharma:** Have you tried any over-the-counter medications for these symptoms?

**[00:04:01] Mr. David Chen:** Yeah, a little bit. I&#x27;ve been taking <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Tylenol</span> when the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">headache</span> was bad. And my wife got me some <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Robitussin DM</span>. I think it has a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">cough</span> suppressant and something to break up the mucus? It helps a little for a few hours, but the cough always comes back.

**[00:04:22] Dr. Anya Sharma:** It sounds like you&#x27;ve been doing the right things for self-care. Based on what you&#x27;re describing – the initial <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">cold-like symptoms</span>, the transition to a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">productive cough with clear sputum</span>, the absence of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">high fever</span>, and that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="33" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">lingering fatigue</span> – this sounds very consistent with a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="34" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">post-viral cough</span>, likely from an episode of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="35" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">acute bronchitis</span> that followed a common cold or another upper respiratory infection. It’s very common for the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="36" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">cough</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="37" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">fatigue</span> to linger for several weeks after the initial infection has cleared.

**[00:04:58] Mr. David Chen:** So you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="38" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">pneumonia</span> or something worse? That&#x27;s what I was worried about.

**[00:05:05] Dr. Anya Sharma:** The lack of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="39" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">high fever</span>, the absence of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="40" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">significant, persistent shortness of breath</span>, and the fact that your <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="41" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">sputum is clear</span> are all reassuring signs that make <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="42" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">pneumonia</span> less likely. However, we always keep it in mind. The plan will be to manage the symptoms, but I&#x27;ll also give you specific red flags to watch for that would require a more urgent, in-person evaluation.

**[00:05:31] Mr. David Chen:** Okay, that makes me feel a bit better.

**[00:05:35] Dr. Anya Sharma:** Good. Now, let’s switch gears for a moment to your chronic conditions, as they can sometimes be related. You&#x27;re currently taking <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="43" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Lisinopril, 10 milligrams</span>, for your <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="44" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">essential hypertension</span>, correct?

**[00:05:51] Mr. David Chen:** That&#x27;s right. One pill every morning.

**[00:05:55] Dr. Anya Sharma:** A persistent, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="45" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">dry cough</span> can sometimes be a side effect of Lisinopril. Your <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="46" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">cough</span> sounds like it started with an illness and is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="47" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">productive</span>, which makes it less likely to be the medication, but it&#x27;s something we must consider. Has the character of your cough changed at all since you started that medication a couple of years ago?

**[00:06:17] Mr. David Chen:** No, I&#x27;ve never had any issues with it before. This is definitely new and different. It feels like a sickness cough, not just a tickle.

**[00:06:28] Dr. Anya Sharma:** Okay, that&#x27;s good to know. And how have your home <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="48" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">blood pressure readings</span> been? Are you still checking them a few times a week?

**[00:06:36] Mr. David Chen:** I am. I wrote them down. This past week, they&#x27;ve been pretty consistent. The top number is usually between <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="49" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">125 and 135</span>, and the bottom number is usually between <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="50" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">75 and 80</span>. This morning it was <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="51" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">128 over 78</span>.

**[00:06:55] Dr. Anya Sharma:** David, that&#x27;s fantastic. Those are excellent numbers. It shows the Lisinopril is working very well and that you&#x27;re doing a great job with monitoring. We&#x27;ll continue the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="52" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Lisinopril at the current 10 milligram dose</span>. No changes are needed there.

**[00:07:12] Mr. David Chen:** Great. One less thing to worry about.

**[00:07:15] Dr. Anya Sharma:** Now, let&#x27;s talk about your cholesterol. You&#x27;re taking <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="53" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Atorvastatin, 20 milligrams, for <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="54" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">hyperlipidemia</span></span>. How have you been tolerating that? Any side effects we&#x27;ve discussed, like <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="55" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">muscle aches or weakness</span>?

**[00:07:31] Mr. David Chen:** You know, it&#x27;s funny you should mention that. I have been having some <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="56" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">aches</span>, but I just assumed it was from feeling sick with this cold thing. Mostly in my legs, like a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="57" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">dull ache in my thighs</span>.

**[00:07:45] Dr. Anya Sharma:** Hmm. Is it more pronounced than the general body aches you had when the illness started? And is it still present now that the other aches have faded?

**[00:07:55] Mr. David Chen:** Yeah, I&#x27;d say so. It&#x27;s not terrible, but I notice it when I&#x27;m walking up the stairs. It’s a bit more than just regular fatigue.

**[00:08:08] Dr. Anya Sharma:** Okay, we need to pay attention to that. Statin-induced myalgia, or <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="58" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">muscle pain</span>, is a known side effect of medications like Atorvastatin. Often it&#x27;s mild, but we should investigate. In the plan I&#x27;ll outline, I&#x27;m going to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="59" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">order some blood work for you, including a lipid panel to see where your cholesterol is, but also a test called a CK level, which checks for muscle inflammation</span>.

**[00:08:35] Mr. David Chen:** Okay. So should I stop <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="60" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">taking the Atorvastatin</span>?

**[00:08:40] Dr. Anya Sharma:** Let&#x27;s not stop it just yet. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="61" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">Let&#x27;s get the blood work first</span>. If the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="62" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">aches</span> are mild and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="63" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">the CK level is normal</span>, we may just monitor it. If it gets worse or the lab test is abnormal, we might consider lowering the dose or <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="64" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="65" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">switching to a different medication like Rosuvastatin or Pravastatin</span></span>. For now, just keep taking it and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="66" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">be mindful of the pain</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="67" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">If it becomes severe, stop the medication and let me know immediately.</span>

**[00:09:12] Mr. David Chen:** Will do.

**[00:09:14] Dr. Anya Sharma:** And how about any other issues? Last time we spoke, you mentioned <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="68" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">occasional heartburn</span>. Has that been bothering you?

**[00:09:24] Mr. David Chen:** It&#x27;s been better, actually. I&#x27;ve been trying to avoid eating late at night like you suggested. I still get that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="69" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">burning feeling in my chest maybe once a week, especially if I have tomato sauce or something spicy</span>. I&#x27;ve been taking the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="70" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Omeprazole you prescribed as needed</span>, and it usually knocks it right out.

**[00:09:45] Dr. Anya Sharma:** I&#x27;m glad to hear the lifestyle changes and the as-needed medication are controlling your <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="71" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD</span>. That sounds like a good, stable plan. No need for any changes there.

**[00:10:01] Mr. David Chen:** Phew. Good.

**[00:10:03] Dr. Anya Sharma:** Okay, so let&#x27;s put this all together and formulate a clear plan of action.

**(Dr. Sharma types on her computer as she speaks.)**

**[00:10:15] Dr. Anya Sharma:** First, for the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="72" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">cough</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="73" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">fatigue</span>. My primary diagnosis at this point is a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="74" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">post-viral syndrome following an acute upper respiratory infection, presenting as acute bronchitis</span>.

**[00:10:32] Mr. David Chen:** That&#x27;s a mouthful.

**[00:10:34] Dr. Anya Sharma:** (chuckles) It is. It just means a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="75" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">lingering cough</span> after a cold. The plan for this is primarily <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="76" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">supportive care</span>. I do not believe <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="77" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">antibiotics</span> are necessary or would be helpful here. I want you to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="78" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">continue to focus on rest and hydration</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="79" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">Drink plenty of water, tea, or broth</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="80" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">Using a humidifier in your bedroom at night can also help soothe your airways</span>.

**[00:11:01] Mr. David Chen:** Okay, I can do that.

**[00:11:04] Dr. Anya Sharma:** You can continue using the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="81" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">combination product with dextromethorphan for <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="82" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">cough suppression</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="83" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">guaifenesin as an expectorant to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="84" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">thin the mucus</span></span></span>. Take it as directed on the box. For the nasal congestion, you might find a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="85" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">saline nasal spray helpful</span>. If it&#x27;s really bothersome, an <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="86" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">over-the-counter steroid nasal spray like Flonase, or <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="87" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">fluticasone</span>, once a day for a week or two</span>, could <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="88" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">reduce some of that post-nasal drip that might be triggering the cough at night</span>.

**[00:11:38] Mr. David Chen:** Oh, I think we have some Flonase at home. I can try that.

**[00:11:42] Dr. Anya Sharma:** Perfect. Now, the important part: the things to watch for. If your symptoms change – for example, if you develop a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="89" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">high fever over 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit</span>, if your <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="90" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">cough gets much worse</span>, if you start <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="91" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">feeling truly short of breath at rest</span>, or if the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="92" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">sputum turns a thick, dark green or yellow color</span> – you need to call me or be seen in person right away. Those could be signs of a secondary bacterial infection like pneumonia.

**[00:12:18] Mr. David Chen:** Okay, I understand. High fever, can&#x27;t breathe, green stuff. Got it.

**[00:12:24] Dr. Anya Sharma:** Exactly. Second, regarding your <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="93" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">well-controlled hypertension</span>. The plan is simple: <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="94" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">continue Lisinopril 10 mg daily</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="95" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">Continue monitoring your blood pressure at home and keep a log</span>.

**[00:12:40] Mr. David Chen:** Yep. Easy enough.

**[00:12:42] Dr. Anya Sharma:** Third, for the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="96" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">hyperlipidemia</span> and the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="97" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">new muscle aches</span>. The plan is to continue the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="98" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Atorvastatin 20 mg</span> for now, but I am putting in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="99" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">an order for blood work at the lab</span>. I want you to get <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="100" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">a lipid panel</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="101" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">a comprehensive metabolic panel</span>, and that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="102" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">creatine kinase, or CK, level</span> we discussed. Please try to get this done in the next week. We will use these results to decide on the next steps for your statin therapy. And as I said, if the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="103" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">muscle pain</span> becomes severe, stop the pill and call me.

**[0T:13:21] Mr. David Chen:** So I just go to the lab downtown and give them my name?

**[00:13:25] Dr. Anya Sharma:** Correct. The order will be in the system electronically by the time we finish this call. The results will come directly to me, and I will message you through the patient portal with the results and my interpretation.

**[00:13:38] Mr. David Chen:** Okay, great.

**[00:13:40] Dr. Anya Sharma:** And finally, for the GERD, continue with your dietary modifications and use the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="104" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Omeprazole 20 mg as needed for breakthrough heartburn</span>. That plan seems to be working well.

**[00:13:54] Mr. David Chen:** It is.

**[00:13:56] Dr. Anya Sharma:** So, to summarize the action items for you: <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="105" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">Get your lab work done in the next week</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="106" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">Continue your current medications, but monitor for <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="107" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">worsening muscle pain</span></span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="108" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Try the Flonase for your <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="109" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">congestion</span></span>. And <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="110" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">monitor for any of the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="111" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">red flag symptoms with the cough</span></span>. Do you have any questions about this plan? Does it all make sense?

**[00:14:20] Mr. David Chen:** No, that&#x27;s all very clear, thank you. I feel much better having a concrete plan. The only other thing I wanted to ask about was sleep. With the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="112" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">cough</span> and the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="113" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">stuffy nose</span>, my <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="114" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">sleep has been terrible</span>. I&#x27;m <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="115" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">waking up three or four times a night</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="116" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">I feel exhausted</span>. Is there anything I can take for that?

**[00:14:45] Dr. Anya Sharma:** That&#x27;s a very good question, and the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="117" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">fatigue</span> is likely a combination of the post-viral state and poor sleep. I&#x27;d prefer to avoid prescription sleep aids right now, as they can have side effects. Sometimes, an over-the-counter antihistamine, like <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="118" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Benadryl</span>, can help with both sleep and the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="119" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">post-nasal drip</span>. However, it can leave you feeling groggy in the morning. Another option is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="120" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">melatonin</span>, which is a more natural supplement. You could try 3 to 5 milligrams of melatonin about an hour before bed.

**[00:15:21] Mr. David Chen:** I think I&#x27;d rather try the melatonin. I&#x27;ve heard good things about it.

**[00:15:26] Dr. Anya Sharma:** Let&#x27;s add that to the plan then. Try <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="121" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">melatonin 3-5 mg at bedtime</span> to help with the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="122" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">insomnia</span> related to your current illness. I also want to refill your prescriptions. I&#x27;ll send a 90-day supply of the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="123" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Lisinopril</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="124" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Atorvastatin</span>, and the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="125" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Omeprazole</span> to your usual pharmacy. You should get a notification from them when it&#x27;s ready.

**[00:15:50] Mr. David Chen:** Perfect. That&#x27;s a huge help.

**[00:15:53] Dr. Anya Sharma:** Alright. Let&#x27;s schedule a follow-up. Given the new <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="126" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">muscle aches</span> and the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="127" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">cough</span>, I&#x27;d like to check in with you sooner than we&#x27;d planned. How about we <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="128" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">schedule another telehealth visit in four weeks</span>? That will give us plenty of time to get the lab results back and see if the cough has resolved. If you&#x27;re not significantly better by then, we&#x27;d need to consider other possibilities, like allergic rhinitis or even an asthma component, and perhaps get a chest X-ray.

**[00:16:25] Mr. David Chen:** Four weeks sounds good. What if the cough gets better before then?

**[00:16:30] Dr. Anya Sharma:** If the cough is gone and you&#x27;re feeling well, you can just <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="129" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">message us and we can push the appointment back to our usual three-month interval</span>. This is just to be proactive.

**[00:16:42] Mr. David Chen:** Okay, that makes sense. Thank you, Dr. Sharma. I really appreciate you taking the time to go through everything so thoroughly.

**[00:16:50] Dr. Anya Sharma:** Of course, David. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m here for. Please don&#x27;t hesitate to send a message through the portal if you have any other questions or if any of those red flag symptoms appear. Otherwise, I&#x27;ll see your lab results come through and will see you in four weeks.

**[00:17:05] Mr. David Chen:** Sounds good. Have a great day.

**[00:17:08] Dr. Anya Sharma:** You too. Feel better soon. Goodbye.

**(The call ends.)**
